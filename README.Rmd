This week is about getting to know the course. We'll cover the syllabus and spend a bit of time getting to know everyone. Then we'll dive into a wild exercise: solving the classic Monty Hall problem using our own simulation in `R`. We will also take our first glance at literate programming: using `R markdown` to code and typeset in one document.

## Preparation
- Install and configure the software we need for the course. See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/sis750/00-getting-started) for detail and instructions.  
- If you want to build or refresh your basic R skills, work through the sample exercises in the [Survival Guide](https://austin-hart-pols.github.io/SurvivalGuide/) or Chapters 2 or 5 of [Dr. Bryanâ€™s Stat 545 text](https://stat545.com/). Get used to typing and executing commands, loading packages, etc. Compare your output with that given in the texts.
